Configure your Claude status bars — themes, colours, and animations. $ARGUMENTS

---

**Finding the script:** Before running any command below, you need the full path to `claude_status.py`. Do this ONCE at the start:

1. Read `~/.claude/settings.json`. If `statusLine.command` contains `claude_status.py`, extract the full script path from that string.
2. If not found, use the Glob tool to search for `**/claude_status.py` inside `~/.claude/plugins/` — pick the result containing `claude-pulse`.
3. If neither works, tell the user: "Run `/claude-pulse:setup` first to install the status bar."

Save the found path as SCRIPT_PATH. Use `python "SCRIPT_PATH"` for all commands below.

## ROUTING — decide what to do based on $ARGUMENTS

### Direct commands (skip the menu, run immediately):

If $ARGUMENTS matches a **theme name** (`default`, `ocean`, `sunset`, `mono`, `neon`, `pride`, `frost`, `ember`, `candy`, `rainbow`):
-> Run `python "SCRIPT_PATH" --theme <name>` directly, no menu.
-> Confirm: "Theme set to **<name>**. The status line will update on the next refresh."

If $ARGUMENTS is `config` or `settings`:
-> Run `python "SCRIPT_PATH" --config` silently.
-> Summarise the settings in your response text (don't show raw ANSI output).

If $ARGUMENTS is exactly `show` (no parts after it), or `show all`, or `colors`, or `colours`, or `preview`:
-> Run TWO separate Bash commands (in parallel) so the output is NOT collapsed behind ctrl+o:
   1. `python "SCRIPT_PATH" --show-themes`
   2. `python "SCRIPT_PATH" --show-colors`
-> IMPORTANT: Show the raw command output DIRECTLY to the user. Do NOT summarise, reformat, or create tables. The commands output coloured ANSI text with live theme previews — the user needs to see the actual coloured bars, not a markdown description of them. Just run the commands and let the output speak for itself.
-> After both commands, say ONLY: "Press **Ctrl+O** to expand and see the colours."

If $ARGUMENTS contains `hide <parts>` or `show <parts>` (with specific parts like extra, timer, etc.):
-> Run the corresponding `--hide` or `--show` command directly.

If $ARGUMENTS is `animate on` or `animate off`:
-> Run `--animate on|off` directly.
-> Confirm: "Animation **<on/off>**. Rainbow colours will flow across your status bar while Claude is active."

If $ARGUMENTS matches `text-color <name>` or `text-colour <name>`:
-> Run `--text-color <name>` directly.
-> Available colours: auto, white, bright_white, cyan, blue, green, yellow, magenta, red, orange, violet, pink, dim, default, none

If $ARGUMENTS matches `currency <symbol>` (e.g. `currency £`, `currency €`, `currency $`):
-> Run `--currency <symbol>` directly.
-> Confirm: "Currency set to **<symbol>**. Extra usage will display as <symbol>amount."

If $ARGUMENTS matches `bar-size <size>` or `bars <size>` (where size is `small`, `medium`, or `large`):
-> Run `--bar-size <size>` directly.
-> Confirm: "Bar size set to **<size>**. The status line will update on the next refresh."

If $ARGUMENTS matches `bar-style <name>` or `style <name>` (where name is `classic`, `block`, `shade`, `pipe`, `dot`, `square`, or `star`):
-> Run `--bar-style <name>` directly.
-> Confirm: "Bar style set to **<name>**. The status line will update on the next refresh."

If $ARGUMENTS matches `layout <name>` (where name is `standard`, `compact`, `minimal`, or `percent-first`):
-> Run `--layout <name>` directly.
-> Confirm: "Layout set to **<name>**. The status line will update on the next refresh."

If $ARGUMENTS is `update`:
-> Run `python "SCRIPT_PATH" --update` and show the output.
-> After a successful update, remind the user to restart Claude Code to use the new version.

### Interactive menu (when $ARGUMENTS is empty, `themes`, `theme`, or `menu`):

**Step 0 — Quick tips & update check:**

First, show the user available quick commands so they know what's possible:

> **Quick commands:** `/claude-pulse:pulse show` preview all themes · `/claude-pulse:pulse ocean` set a theme · `/claude-pulse:pulse config` see settings · `/claude-pulse:pulse update` check for updates

Then run `python "SCRIPT_PATH" --config` silently to get the current settings. If the output contains "update available" or similar, also tell the user:

> **A new version of claude-pulse is available!** Run `/claude-pulse:pulse update` to get the latest features and fixes.

Then continue with the wizard. If no update is available, skip the update message.

**Step 1:** Run `python "SCRIPT_PATH" --themes-demo` and show the output to the user. This prints all 10 themes with their actual coloured bars so the user can see every option before picking.

**Step 2:** Show the first `AskUserQuestion` picker (page 1 of 3):

```
Question: "Pick a theme from the preview above"
Header: "Theme"
multiSelect: false
Options:
  - "rainbow" — "Full-spectrum colours that flow across the status bar"
  - "default" — "Classic green → yellow → red traffic-light"
  - "ocean" — "Cool cyan → blue → magenta"
  - "More themes..." — "See all 10 themes"
```

**Step 2b:** If "More themes...", show page 2:

```
Question: "Pick a theme"
Header: "Theme"
multiSelect: false
Options:
  - "frost" — "Icy light blue → steel blue → bright white"
  - "ember" — "Gold amber → hot orange → bright red"
  - "candy" — "Hot pink → purple → bright cyan"
  - "More themes..." — "See neon, sunset, pride, mono"
```

**Step 2c:** If "More themes..." again, show page 3:

```
Question: "Pick a theme"
Header: "Theme"
multiSelect: false
Options:
  - "neon" — "Vivid bright green → yellow → red"
  - "sunset" — "Warm yellow → orange → red"
  - "pride" — "Violet → green → pink"
  - "← Back" — "Return to the first set of themes"
```

If "← Back", go back to Step 2. Mono is available via "Other" on any page (it's visible in the preview above).

**Step 3:** After the user picks a theme, apply it with `--theme <name>`.

**Step 4:** If the chosen theme is NOT rainbow, ask about text colour. Use the theme-specific recommendation as the top option:

Theme-specific text colour recommendations:
- **ocean** → recommend **cyan** — "Cool cyan that complements the blue/magenta bars"
- **sunset** / **ember** → recommend **yellow** — "Warm tone that complements the orange/red bars"
- **frost** → recommend **cyan** — "Icy tone that complements the blue/white bars"
- **candy** → recommend **pink** — "Pink that complements the purple/cyan bars"
- **neon** → recommend **green** — "Bright green that matches the neon energy"
- **pride** → recommend **violet** — "Violet that complements the green/pink bars"
- **default** / **mono** / anything else → recommend **white** — "Neutral light grey that works with any bars"

```
Question: "What colour for the labels and percentages?"
Header: "Text colour"
multiSelect: false
Options:
  - "<theme recommendation> (Recommended)" — "<reason from above>"
  - "White" — "Neutral light grey — works with any theme"
  - "Default" — "Your terminal's default text colour"
  - "<a contrasting option>" — pick one that contrasts with the theme: cyan, magenta, green, yellow, etc.
```

If they pick the recommended option for a specific theme, use `--text-color <colour>` (e.g. `--text-color cyan` for ocean).
If they pick "White", use `--text-color white`.
If they pick "Default", use `--text-color default`.

**Step 5:** Ask about animation:

```
Question: "Enable rainbow animation on the status bar?"
Header: "Animation"
multiSelect: false
Options:
  - "Off (Recommended)" — "Static theme colours, clean and simple"
  - "On" — "Rainbow colours flow across the status bar while Claude is active"
```

Apply with `--animate on|off`. Animation overlays rainbow colours on any theme. It runs on every status line refresh — no hooks or background processes.

**Step 6:** Ask about bar size:

```
Question: "How wide should the progress bars be?"
Header: "Bar size"
multiSelect: false
Options:
  - "Medium (Recommended)" — "8 characters — balanced default"
  - "Small" — "4 characters — compact, more room for text"
  - "Large" — "12 characters — wide bars, more visual detail"
```

Apply with `--bar-size <small|medium|large>`.

**Step 7:** Ask about context window:

```
Question: "Show context window usage on the status bar?"
Header: "Context"
multiSelect: false
Options:
  - "On (Recommended)" — "Shows how full Claude's memory/context is with a progress bar"
  - "Off" — "Hide context usage"
```

If "On", run `--show context`. If "Off", run `--hide context`.

**Step 8:** Check extra credits status by running `python "SCRIPT_PATH" --config` silently and checking the "Extra Credits" section.

If credits are **active** (Status: active), ask:

```
Question: "You have extra credits enabled. How should they appear?"
Header: "Extra credits"
multiSelect: false
Options:
  - "Dynamic (Recommended)" — "Auto-shows when extra credits are active, hides when not"
  - "Always show" — "Always display the extra credits bar"
  - "Hide" — "Never show extra credits on the status line"
```

If they pick "Dynamic": this is the default behaviour — no command needed.
If they pick "Always show", run `--show extra`.
If they pick "Hide", run `--hide extra`.

If credits are **not active**, ask a simpler version:

```
Question: "Show extra credits on the status bar if enabled in your account?"
Header: "Extra credits"
multiSelect: false
Options:
  - "Dynamic (Recommended)" — "Auto-shows when extra credits are active, hidden otherwise"
  - "Hide" — "Never show extra credits"
```

If "Dynamic", no command needed (default). If "Hide", run `--hide extra`.

**Step 9:** Ask about currency (only if they chose "Dynamic" or "Always show"):

```
Question: "What currency symbol for your extra credits?"
Header: "Currency"
multiSelect: false
Options:
  - "£ (GBP)" — "British Pound (default)"
  - "$ (USD)" — "US Dollar"
  - "€ (EUR)" — "Euro"
```

The user can also pick "Other" and type any symbol (e.g. ¥, ₹, kr, CHF, etc.).

Apply with `--currency <symbol>`.

**Step 10:** Confirm everything:
"All set! Your status line is now using **<theme>** with **<text colour>** text and animation **<on/off>**. It shows session usage, weekly usage, context window, model name, and plan tier by default. It'll update on the next refresh or restart Claude Code to see it immediately."

If credits were shown, also mention: "Your bonus credits will appear as **Extra ━━━━ <currency>used/<currency>limit**."

---

### Visibility settings (when $ARGUMENTS is `visibility` or `toggles`):

Use AskUserQuestion:

```
Question: "Which parts should be visible on your status line?"
Header: "Visibility"
multiSelect: true
Options:
  - "Session usage" — "5-hour usage block with progress bar and timer"
  - "Weekly usage" — "7-day rolling limit across all models"
  - "Context window" — "How full Claude's context/memory is"
  - "Model name" — "Shows which model is active (Opus, Sonnet, etc.)"
```

Then apply the appropriate `--show` and `--hide` commands based on what the user selected vs deselected.

Mention: "You can also toggle **plan name**, **timer**, **extra credits**, and more with `/pulse show <part>` or `/pulse hide <part>`."

---

## DISPLAY RULES

- After any theme/visibility change, tell the user the status line will update on the next refresh (~30 seconds) or they can restart Claude Code to see it immediately.
- When running `--config`, summarise in your own text — don't show raw terminal output (it has ANSI codes that collapse in the UI).
- Always be enthusiastic and brief. This is a fun cosmetic feature.
