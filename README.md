## What is this?

**claude-pulse** adds a live status bar to the bottom of your Claude Code CLI window showing:

- **Session usage** — how much of your current 5-hour block you've used
- **Time remaining** — countdown until your session resets
- **Weekly usage** — your 7-day rolling usage across all models
- **Plan tier** — auto-detected (Pro, Max 5x, Max 20x)

No guesswork. No scanning log files. It pulls the **exact same numbers** shown on [claude.ai/settings/usage](https://claude.ai/settings/usage) via Anthropic's OAuth API.

## Features

### Colour-coded progress bars

The bars change colour based on your usage level so you can tell at a glance how close you are to your limits:

| Usage | Colour | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 0–49% | Green | Plenty of headroom |
| 50–79% | Yellow | Getting warm |
| 80%+ | Red | Close to the limit |

### Lightweight and fast

- **Single Python file** — no dependencies, no pip install, just Python 3.6+
- **30-second cache** — API is only called once every 30 seconds, cached responses return instantly
- **Zero config needed** — auto-detects your plan and credentials from Claude Code

### Auto-detected plan

Reads your subscription tier directly from Claude Code's credentials file. Supports:
- **Pro** — standard plan
- **Max 5x** — 5x Pro usage
- **Max 20x** — 20x Pro usage

If you upgrade your plan, just restart Claude Code and it picks up the new tier automatically.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PigeonDroid/claude-pulse.git
cd claude-pulse
```

### 2. Install the status line

```bash
python claude_status.py --install
```

This adds the status line to your `~/.claude/settings.json` automatically.

### 3. Restart Claude Code

Close and reopen Claude Code. The status bar appears at the bottom of your terminal.

That's it. No virtual environments, no dependencies, no build steps.

## How it works

```
Claude Code starts
    ↓
Calls claude_status.py (passes session JSON via stdin)
    ↓
Check cache (~30s TTL)
    ├── Fresh? → Return cached line instantly
    └── Stale? → Read OAuth token from ~/.claude/.credentials.json
                     ↓
                 GET https://api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage
                     ↓
                 Format status line with coloured bars
                     ↓
                 Cache result, print to stdout
```

The status line updates whenever Claude Code's conversation updates (roughly every 300ms), but the API is only hit once every 30 seconds to keep things fast and respectful.

## Configuration

Edit `config.json` to change the cache interval:

```json
{
  "cache_ttl_seconds": 30
}
```

Lower values = more frequent API calls. Higher values = faster response but slightly staler data. Default of 30 seconds is a good balance.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.6+** (no external packages)
- **Claude Code** with an active Pro or Max subscription
- **Windows, macOS, or Linux**

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Status line doesn't appear | Run `python claude_status.py --install` and restart Claude Code |
| Shows "No credentials found" | Make sure you're logged in to Claude Code (`claude /login`) |
| Shows wrong plan tier | Restart Claude Code — credentials refresh on startup |
| Stale percentages | Delete the cache: `~/.cache/claude-status/cache.json` (Linux/Mac) or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\claude-status\cache.json` (Windows) |
